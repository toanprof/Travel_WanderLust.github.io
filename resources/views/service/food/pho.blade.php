                                <p>Legends and myths mean that many histories in Vietnam are coloured a variety of
                                    shades. This is also the case with phở, the country’s most famous dish, and its most
                                    successful culinary export. In the capital city of Hanoi, phở is a staple breakfast
                                    dish.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>From the early hours, phở stalls set up shop along the sidewalks. Shrouded in clouds
                                    of steam, the cook will assemble each bowl to order. Boiling broth is poured over a
                                    bed of soft rice noodles and sliced meat, and topped with a handful of chopped herbs
                                    and chives. Each diner will customise their bowl to taste, with squeezes of lemon,
                                    slices of red chili, sprigs of basil, and dabs of hoisin sauce. It's an experience
                                    no visit to Vietnam is complete without.
                                <p>While Nam Dinh is believed to be the geographical cradle of phở, few would dispute
                                    that its spiritual home is Hanoi. It was Hanoi's intersection of historical and
                                    cultural factors made phở popular.</p>

                                <p>The history of phở begins at the end of the 19th century, at the peak of French
                                    colonialism. French demand led to a greater availability of beef in Vietnam. This in
                                    turn produced a surplus of beef bones, which were used by Chinese and Vietnamese
                                    vendors to deepen and perfect the flavour of the Nam Dinh broth.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Over the years, phở gained traction in Hanoi. It evolved from a noodle soup called
                                    xáo trâu -- a simple dish made with slices of water buffalo meat cooked in broth
                                    with rice vermicelli -- into a delicate and balanced creation. Buffalo meat was
                                    swapped with beef, round rice noodles were added, the flavour of the broth was
                                    refined, and the classic Hanoi phở was perfected.</p>
                                <p>Migrant workers from the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong loved the new
                                    take, due to its similarity to dishes from back home. The Vietnamese, having
                                    developed a taste for beef, grew equally enamoured. By the 1930s, gánh phở — roaming
                                    vendors shouldering mobile kitchens on bamboo poles — had become a common sight in
                                    the streets of the Old Quarter.

                                <p>While debate rages as to the location of Vietnam’s best pho, it could be argued that
                                    the dish hasn’t actually evolved all that radically since the early years. Different
                                    cuts of meat have been brought to the table and diners can choose from a range of
                                    beef cuts including rare beef (tái), flank (nạm), brisket (gầu), tripe (sách),
                                    tendon (gan) and meatballs (bò viên). The invention of chicken phở (phở gà) in 1939
                                    caused ructions for a while. But, by and large, pho has stayed true to its original
                                    tenets. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>That said, phở is not an immovable feast. Some young chefs in Vietnam are
                                    experimenting with items such as brown rice noodles and fresh pho noodle rolls. In
                                    2018, Anan Saigon famously introduced a 100$ phở with truffle oil, wagyu and foie
                                    gras. And overseas, chefs are getting even more inventive with additions such as
                                    crawfish and sous vide beef.</p>
                                <p>These days, beef bones, flank steak oxtails, charred onion, charred ginger and spices
                                    including star anise, cinnamon, cloves, black cardamom and coriander are used to
                                    make the slow-cooked broth. Chicken phở is an equally popular alternative to the
                                    original. In the north, garnishes are limited to fresh chilli slices, lemon, and a
                                    few herbs; but in the south, the phở is noticeably sweeter and there's a wide array
                                    of types to choose from. In Central Vietnam, you can even find phở with poached
                                    eggs. </p>
